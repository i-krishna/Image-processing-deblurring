How to run the program for image deblurring?
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Step 0: Since you are reading this file, you have succesfully
completed Step 0.

Step 1 (Optional): Open the file ExptSetup.m

Step 2 (Optional): Edit the file to set the self-explanatory
parameters in the file to test with different images (eg. lena, boats,
cameraman etc), blurs, noise levels etc and save it.

Step 3: Run the ExptSetup file

IMPORTANT NOTE: In case of encountered errors check below for a possible fix.

ForWaRDSetup.m : Sets up the experiment using the chosen parameter in ExptSetup

RegParamSearch.m : Empirically searches the regularization parameter (recommended)

RunForWaRD.m : Runs the WaRD algorithm on the setup experiment

Functions such as discrete wavelet transforms (mdwt.m and midwt.m) and
redundant wavelet transforms (mrdwt.m and mirdwt.m) from the Rice
Wavelet toolbox are used in this implementation of the ForWaRD algorithm.

Image deblurring Notes: 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

1) The package is designed to run on Sun Solaris, Linux, or Windows
environment. I have tried to include precompiled mex files for many
common operating systems, but the list is not complete. If you have
any other platform, then you would need to download the Rice Wavelet
tool box, compile the C files for your platform, and then run the
programs. This could be particularly true if you are using new Windows
releases or new Linux releases.  Also see
http://www.dsp.rice.edu/software/ for more details on the Rice wavelet
toolbox.


If ERROR == "Warning: One or more output arguments not assigned during call to 'mrdwt'.", 

  SOLUTION: Compile the C files in the routines directory for your system.

	1) Change the matlab working directory to "routines" 
	2) Type "compile" at the matlab command prompt. This will
	   compile the C files for your operating system. Ofcourse,
	   you will need a C compiler to get this running.


2) If the regularization parameter is pre-set, the program takes less
than a minute for 256x256 images on a 300MHz, 128 MB, Pentium 3
machine with Linux running on it. To search the regularization
parameter, it takes an additional 2 minutes.

3) Currently, the software is suited to run square images only. The
program uses around 30MB of space for 256x256 images. Decreasing the
number of decomposition levels would help reduce the memory required.

4) The current package differs from the previously released package in
the type of Fourier shrinkage employed. This package relies on
Tikhonov regularization in the Fourier domain, while the previous
package used a parametrized Wiener filter.
